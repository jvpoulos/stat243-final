#This is a rough draft of the code for the rejection sampling test.

#The function rejectiontest returns 3 logicals of whether we accept the sample,
#have to update h(x), and checks if the function h(x) is log-concave at x_star.  
#If it is not log-concave, then the function is supposed to stop.

#Suppose x_star is a sample from s_k
